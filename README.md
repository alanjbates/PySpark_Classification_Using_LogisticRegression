# PySpark Classification using Logistic Regression

This is an example of using PySpark to make a categorical prediction based on 3 different input features.

Using the baby names dataset (found in baby-names/names-classifier) we were able to build a model that can predict the sex of a person based on their age, name, and state they were born in.
